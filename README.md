# DataQualityControl in AWS
# City of Vancouver Employee Data Quality Control

This project implements a data quality control pipeline for the City of Vancouverâ€™s Employee Remuneration and Expenses dataset using AWS Glue Studio. The pipeline ensures data accuracy by applying completeness, uniqueness, and value validation rules, and separates clean and rejected data automatically.
