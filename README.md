# City of Vancouver Employee Data Quality Control

This project implements a data quality control pipeline for the City of Vancouverâ€™s Employee Remuneration and Expenses dataset using AWS Glue Studio. The pipeline ensures data accuracy by applying completeness, uniqueness, and value validation rules. It also ensures data security through encryption, versioning, replication, and enables governance through monitoring and auditing.

## AWS KMS Key Management
To secure the data at rest, I created three customer-managed keys in AWS KMS: `RawBucketKeyCoVIshan`, `CleanBucketKeyCoVIshan`, and `CuratedBucketKeyCoVIshan`. Each key protects its respective S3 bucket for fine-grained control and auditing.

## S3 Bucket Encryption (Raw Bucket)
Enabled server-side encryption using SSE-KMS on the raw bucket with its KMS key.

## S3 Bucket Versioning (Raw Bucket)
Enabled versioning on the raw bucket to preserve object history and recover from accidental deletions.

## S3 Replication (Clean Bucket)
Set up replication from clean bucket to another bucket in the same region for durability and disaster recovery.

## AWS Glue Job Flow
Created an ETL job in Glue Studio named `emp-Cov-Ishan-QC` that loads raw data, applies quality checks, and routes data.

## How to Run
1. Upload data to raw S3 bucket.
2. Run the Glue job.
3. Review curated and rejected data in S3.
4. Use CloudWatch and CloudTrail to monitor and audit.
